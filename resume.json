In addition to my courses, I work on full-stack web projects in my spare time to supplement my learning in software development. I've had one previous full-stack development co-op and have been a teaching assistant for two undergrad courses at UBC. Before entering the computer science program, I studied engineering physics and was on two robotics design teams. In my spare time, I like to play piano, play with my dog, and draw.",
